## Why NextMeeting?

You're in the zone. Deep in code, writing, whatever. Then you glance at the clock — *wait, did I miss that meeting?*

NextMeeting sits quietly in your menu bar, showing exactly when your next meeting starts and what it is. When it's time, press **⌘⇧J** from anywhere to join instantly. No clicking through calendar apps. No hunting for links.
